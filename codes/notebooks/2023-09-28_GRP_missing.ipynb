    "The wage gap between White and Black populations was higher after we subsetted for \"not hispanic\" whites than the one where we didn't account for the ethnicity in our weighted average income. This might be because the typical understanding of \"white\" people is different from what the US Census has classified them as, and as a result some of the hispanic populations who might generally be viewed as marginalized communities get inlcuded in the \"white\" category thereby bringing down the mean values."
