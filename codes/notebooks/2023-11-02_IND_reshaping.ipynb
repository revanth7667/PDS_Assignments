    "# Reshaping Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into actually doing some exercises, a few notes about reshaping in `pandas`. \n",
    "\n",
    "**So many tools:** As is so often the case with `pandas`, when there are multiple ways that something can be done, `pandas` implements all of them, even it if results in a lot of duplication of funcationality. As a result, there are several sets of methods that do very similar things, and which can be hard to keep straights: \n",
    "\n",
    "- `melt` and `pivot`: Tools for moving a dataset from long-to-wide (`pivot`) or wide-to-long (`melt`).\n",
    "- `pivot_table`: Like `pivot`, but allows you to do aggregations during the reshape if you want.\n",
    "- `stack` and `unstack`: Like `melt` and `pivot`, but only for use when your variables are stored in indices. I don't use these much. \n",
    "\n",
    "Personally, **I find melt and pivot most useful.** `pivot_table` *can* do aggregations during the reshape, but you can always do aggregations yourself using `groupby`. :) \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, I have to go look at [these pictures](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/reshaping.html)... every time I reshape. Don't hesistate to look them up for help!\n",
    "\n",
    "**What SHOULD I want my data to look like?** Just a reminder that a natural question to ask is \"in what format should I want my data?\" Obviously this question is subjective, but as you read in the Hadley Wickham [piece I assigned](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.html), this is a good standard definition for a \"tidy\" dataset to which we might aspire: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Each variable forms a column.\n",
    "2. Each observation forms a row.\n",
    "3. Each type of observational unit forms a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, I'm a big fan of this approach, and I think it's a good one to use (especially numbers 1 and 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the question of what forms an \"observation\" depends on the analysis you plan to run (which depends on the answer you seek to ask! See! EVERYTHING ALWAYS COMES BACK TO THE QUESTION YOU ARE SEEKING TO ANSWER!). Suppose you have data on GDP from different countries for many years. If you plan to run a panel analysis where each observation is a country-year, then each row should be a country-year. But if you plan to do a country-level analysis using measures of, say, GDP variation over time, then each row should be a country!\n"
